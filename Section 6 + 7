In these two units, it tell me more about Git's abilities. What can I do to be an expert at Git.
IN the first section, it give me information about how to use Git remotely such as: create a new one, pull or push it from Git and how to delete
remote branches.
Moreover, I know about GUI and SourceTree which is GIt GUI. It seem a little bit similar to Git but I think it is more mordern than Git.
